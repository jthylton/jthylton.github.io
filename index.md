## About Me
- The 'ron' in Jaron is pronounced 'ren'.
- My experiences are in the realms of teaching/tutoring and computer science/security. Also a teensy bit of hardware hacking. 
- I'm currently on a semester break between schools, but otherwise I'm a rising third-year undergrad studying computer science.
- Recently got [certified in 'IT Automation' by Google](https://coursera.org/share/81eacf9aefc5d0b845c812ea09dbf7e3), so I'm employable now!

## My Mantra
- Learn how things work so you can solve problems, or at least know how to begin. 

## Stuff I Do
- Read a lot of fiction, watch a lot of non-fiction
- Cooking, sometimes baking.
- Karate, martial arts in general.
- Getting back into making music.

## Work
- I'm actually looking for work! Tutoring and IT are the kinds of work I'm currently looking at, but I'm certainly open to other, more SWE-like avenues. I can send my resume upon request to jaron(dot)hylton(at)gmail(dot)com. 
- I used to sell cutlery for CUTCO. I was top of my office by the second week. I learned a lot about how to observe and reciprocate the needs and desires of the customer into my own speech. After another few weeks I left for school at Northeastern.
- I write and edit. I've mostly written/edited research based reports and instructional material. It helps me learn more about the topics involved and better my own writing.

## SWE
- Experience writing on linux command line, C programlets, and Python scripts. This is most of what I've written. Also learned some Bash, I just like Python more.
- Made a couple of JS webapps for a couple of hackathons. Both need heavy refinement before presentation, but were good introductions to Angular and React.
- Written a decent amount of Java for classes, lots of unit testing, working on integration testing.
- Currently running around between learning JS data visualiztions, studying category theory for functional programming, and trying out Rust.

## Volunteering
- Instructor for BESS Empower Yourself Program, August - October 2020.
- Tutored with the Black Engineering Student Society at Northeastern Fall 2019 into Spring 2020. 
- Design Chair/Communication Chair/Secretary for NUCoSMO, Northeastern's Computer Science Menotring Organization, during Spring 2020.
- Event Coordinator for NURobotics, Northeastern's Robotics Club, Fall 2019 til the end of Spring 2020.

## Formative High School Stuff
- Founding co-captain of QHSS Robotics Team (Team Spark). Taught people how to use Arduinos!
- Founding co-captain of QHSS Computer Sciecne Team (Team Cyber). Taught people how computers communicate! (+ learned a bunch about networks!)
- Founding member of QHSS Tri-M Music Honor Society. Taught people how to play instruments! (+ performed!)
- Assitant coaching for YECA Bears Softball/Baseball Team. Taught people how to swing a bat!
