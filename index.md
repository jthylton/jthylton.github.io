### My Schtick

I like learning, specifically learning things that can in turn help others.

# About Me
- The 'ron' in Jaron is pronounced 'rin'.
- My experiences lie in the realms of teaching/tutoring and copmuter science. 
- I'm currently a rising third-year at Northeastern University, but that may change soon.
- My main interests right now are figuring out how the networks network (in more detail), how game theory does and doesn't work in ethical arguments, and how to improve my cooking.

# Paid Work
- I'm actually currently looking for work! Can send resume upon request to jaron.hylton(at)gmail(dot)com.
- I used to sell cutlery for CUTCO. I was top of my office by the second week. I learned a lot about how to observe and reciprocate the needs and desires of the customer into my own speech on the fly. After another few weeks I felt like I stopped learning and was sure that I didn't enjoy this kind of work, so I left.
- I write and edit persuasive works. I've mostly written/edited relatively short works aimed at a singular, known audience for pretty low prices, but only sporadically. I do it because it helps me learn more about the topics involved and hone my own rhetorical strategies.
