## About Me
- The 'ron' in Jaron is pronounced 'ren'.
- My experiences lie in the realms of teaching/tutoring and copmuter science/security. 
- I'm currently a rising third-year at Northeastern University.
- My main goals right now are to obtain security certifications (Security+ is my current goal), flesh out my Slideshow project (basically make a slideshow toy program in every language I'm familiar with and make them look good), and improve my cooking.

## My Theme

I like learning, specifically learning things that can in turn protect others or teach them to protect themselves.

## Work
- I'm actually currently looking for work! I can send my resume upon request to jaron(dot)hylton(at)gmail(dot)com.
- I used to sell cutlery for CUTCO. I was top of my office by the second week. I learned a lot about how to observe and reciprocate the needs and desires of the customer into my own speech. After another few weeks I felt that I wasn't learning and was sure that I didn't enjoy this kind of work, so I left.
- I write and edit written works. I've mostly written/edited relatively short nonfiction works aimed at a singular, known audience. I do it because it helps me learn more about the topics involved and hone my own rhetorical strategies.

## SWE
- Made a couple of JS webapps for a couple of hackathons. Both need heavy refinement, but were good introductions to Typescript/Angular and React.
- Experience writing command line C programs and Python scripts.
- Written a decent amount of Java for classes, lots of unit testing.
- Learning Docker for PM and DevOps.
- As I said, I'm trying to make a slideshow-like program for as many languages as I comfortably can. I realized it requires me to handle I/O, file manipulation, data structures, display, and gui, so I kinda need to know a bit of each language to actually make something presentable.  

## Volunteering
- Started designing a website for Mystic Valley Engineering Student Society, but work has since stopped.
- Tutored with the Black Engineering Student Society at Northeastern Spring 2020 (pre-corona). 
- Design Chair/Communication Chair/Secretary for NUCoSMO, Northeastern's Computer Science Menotring Organization, during Spring 2020.
- Event Coordinator for NURobotics, Northeastern's Robotics Club, since Fall 2019.

## Formative High School Stuff
- Founding co-captain of QHSS Robotics Team (Team Spark). Taught people how to use Arduinos!
- Founding co-captain of QHSS Computer Sciecne Team (Team Cyber). Taught people how computers communicate! (+ learned a bunch about networks!)
- Founding member of QHSS Tri-M Music Honor Society. Taught people how to play instruments! (+ performed!)
- Assitant coaching for YECA Bears Softball Team. Taught people how to swing!
